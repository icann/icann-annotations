   This document lists the implementation status of cryptographic
   algorithms used with DNSSEC.  These algorithms are maintained in an
   IANA registry at http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers.
   Because this document establishes the implementation status of every
   algorithm, it has been listed as a reference for the registry itself.

   Given significance of status change of RSAMD5 algorithm, a reference

<div class="note">
"RSAMD5 has an implementation status of Must Not Implement because of
known weaknesses in MD5."
<br/><br/>
This is very important. An additional reference would lower likelihood
that DNS Implementors will overlook the important piece of information.
