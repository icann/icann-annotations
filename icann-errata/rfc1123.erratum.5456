<div class="original"><pre>
                 This is required because of the long delay after a TCP
                 connection is closed until its socket pair can be
                 reused, to allow multiple transfers during a single FTP
                 session.  Sending a port command can avoided if a
                 transfer mode other than stream is used, by leaving the
                 data transfer connection open between transfers.
