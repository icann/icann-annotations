Several other validity checks that should be performed in addition to
insuring that the file is syntactically correct:

   1. All RRs in the file should have the same class.

   2. Exactly one SOA RR should be present at the top of the zone.

   3. If delegations are present and glue information is required,
      it should be present.

   4. Information present outside of the authoritative nodes in the
      zone should be glue information, rather than the result of an
      origin or similar error.

<div class="note">
[ WK (OpsAD): This is correct, and should be considered / included if
this RFC is updated. ]
<p/>
RFC 1034 Section 4.2.1 vaguely specifies that NS RRs are expected to be
found at zone apex but it is missing in the original algorithm above.
This erratum adds explicit requirement for NS RR at zone apex.
<p/>
Even more importantly this expectation was built into subsequent RFCs,
e.g. RFC 2181 which would break if NS was present only in the parent
zone but not in the child zone.
