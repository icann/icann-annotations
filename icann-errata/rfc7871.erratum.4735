   7.   Due its internal implementation, ANS finds a response that is
        tailored for the whole /16 of the client that performed the
        query.

   8.   ANS adds an ECS option in the response, containing:
[...]
        *  SCOPE PREFIX-LENGTH set to 0x30, indicating a /48 network.

<div class="note">
The prose description in step 7 does not match the ECS option described
in step 8. Either both should say "/16" or both should say "/48".
Probably /48 was meant, since a /16 would be a huge amount of IPv6
address space.
