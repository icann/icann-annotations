<div class="note">
The original text makes it sound like preparation is ONLY validating
that the characters in a string are allowed in the underlying PRECIS
string class, however, some profiles (for example, see the
UsernameCaseMapped profile) specify that some of the rules must be
applied first (in the case of UsernameCaseMapped, preparation includes
first applying the Width rule).
