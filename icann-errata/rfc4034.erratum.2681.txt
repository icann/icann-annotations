   The key tag is the same for all DNSKEY algorithm types except
   algorithm 1 (please see Appendix B.1 for the definition of the key
   tag for algorithm 1).  The key tag algorithm is the sum of the wire
   format of the DNSKEY RDATA broken into 2 octet groups.  First, the
   RDATA (in wire format) is treated as a series of 2 octet groups.
   These groups are then added together, ignoring any carry bits.

<hr/>
<div class="note">This change comes from the example implementation. The accumulator, ac,
is required ("assumed") to be 32-bits or larger, and the carry bits are
added to the accumulator before returning:
<pre>
ac += (ac &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xFFFF;
