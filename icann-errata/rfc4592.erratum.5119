4.7.  NSEC RRSet at a Wildcard Domain Name

   Wildcard domain names in DNSSEC signed zones will have an NSEC RRSet.
   Synthesis of these records will only occur when the query exactly
   matches the record.  Synthesized NSEC RRs will not be harmful as they
   will never be used in negative caching or to generate a negative
   response [RFC2308].

<div class="note">
Synthesizing these records would destroy the semantics of the NSEC chain
and could be very harmful if implementations would cache them and use
them for "Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache" (RFC 8198).
