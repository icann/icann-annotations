<div class="note">
This issue has been reported to the unicode consortium
(<http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2015/15277-pubrev.html>), according to which:
U+1806 is not a control character; RFC 3454 is mistaken in mapping it
to nothing, since the character always has a distinct visual appearance;
For more information about the character, see page 528 of Core
Specification, Version 8.0.
