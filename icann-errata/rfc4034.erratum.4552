<div class="correct">It should say:<pre>
These groups are then added together<del>, ignoring any carry bits</del><ins> with at least 32-bit precision,
retaining any carry bits.
The carry bits are then added to the result, and finally, only the lower
16 bits of the result are used as the key tag. Note that this means any
carries generated during the addition of the carry bits are ignored.
This, in turn, means that the keytag calculation is often the same as
reduction modulo 65535, but not always</ins>.

<div class="note">
Errata 2681 already proposes a fix to Appendix B, however the proposed
fix is not quite clear. The first part of the corrected text is from
2681.
<br/>
Its worth pointing this out because a naive analysis says in fact the
keytag is exactly the same as reduction modulo 65535, and this has
already wasted a fair amount of time.
<br/>
It is also worth pointing out, perhaps, that this is a poor choice of
algorithm for this particular application as it interacts badly with the
properties of keys.
