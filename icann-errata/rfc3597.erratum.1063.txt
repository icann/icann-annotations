   As a courtesy to implementors, it is hereby noted that the complete
   set of such previously published RR types that contain embedded
   domain names, and whose DNSSEC canonical form therefore involves
   downcasing according to the DNS rules for character comparisons,
   consists of the RR types NS, MD, MF, CNAME, SOA, MB, MG, MR, PTR,
   HINFO, MINFO, MX, HINFO, RP, AFSDB, RT, SIG, PX, NXT, NAPTR, KX, SRV,
   DNAME, and A6.

<div class="note">
Compare with RFC 4034 (section 6.2):
<br/>
<pre>
"3.  if the type of the RR is NS, MD, MF, CNAME, SOA, MB, MG, MR,PTR,
HINFO, MINFO, MX, HINFO, RP, AFSDB, RT, SIG, PX, NXT, NAPTR, KX,
SRV, DNAME, A6, RRSIG, or NSEC, all uppercase US-ASCII letters in
the DNS names contained within the RDATA are replaced by the
corresponding lowercase US-ASCII letters;"
</pre>
<br/>
Almost exactly the same list.  One HINFO too much is no issue,
but if this actually should be TXT it's a real typo.
<br/>
neither TXT nor HINFO contain domain names in RDATA, so it's a bug in
both
RFC 3597 and 4034, although one that doesn't hurt. One could also argue
that the list lacks NSAP-PTR, but then that's as obsolete as MD ans MF.
