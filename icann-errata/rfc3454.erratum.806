<div class="note">
This is not true as the tables in this appendix consist of lines with
one prohibited code point _range_ per line.  The format of the lines
are the value of the starting code point of the range, a hyphen,
the value of the ending code point of the range, a semicolon,
and a comment which is the informal name of the range in square
brackets.
If the range contains only one code point, then the hyphen and the
ending
code point value are omitted, and the comment contains the name of
the code point without brackets.
