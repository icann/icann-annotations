No "case conversion" or "case folding" is done during such output operations, thus "preserving" case.

<div class="note">
Whose case is preserved? The case of the label in the DNS query or the
case of the label in the DNS database? In other words, if there is a DNS
record for ietf.org and I query IETF.org, should the DNS response say
ietf.org or IETF.org? I would expect it's the former so that the DNS
administrator can inform the DNS requester about the preferred
capitalization but I can't figure this out on the basis of the RFC. Does
output case preservation refer to something else? All I observe is that
tools like dig return the latter when I run 'dig IETF.org'. Maybe an
errata is not the right place to ask for clarification but given the
name of the RFC, I would expect to find a clear answer to this question
in the RFC.

After discussion with the RFC author and the errata author, the
conclusion is that the RFC isn't wrong but is arguably unclear for some
readers.
