In A:

Code point:

The code point, or code points, to which this rule is to be
applied.  Normally, this implies that if any of the code points in
a label is as defined, then the rules should be applied.  If
evaluated to True, the code point is OK as used; if evaluated to
False, it is not OK.

For the rule to be evaluated to True for the label, it MUST be 
evaluated separately for every occurrence of the Code point in the 
label; each of those evaluations must result in True.</ins>

The original text did not make it clear whether the actual rule is to be

This
is a regular expression that can be interpreted in multiple ways, plus
it does not take into account the case where more than one U+200C exists
in a label.
