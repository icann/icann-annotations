<div class="original"><pre>
   "QNAME" - the name in the query section of an answer, or where this
   resolves to a CNAME, or CNAME chain, the data field of the last
   CNAME.
</pre></div>

<div class="correct">It should say:<pre>
   "QNAME" - <i>the name in the query section (RFC 1034, section 3.7.1)</i>.
</pre></div>

<div class="note">
RFC 2308 is the only RFC that defines QNAME this way. Original
definition in RFC 1034 is clear, and is used by all other RFC since.
(This point was raised during the development of RFC 8020, and is now
discussed in the context of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8499/">draft-ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis</a>)
