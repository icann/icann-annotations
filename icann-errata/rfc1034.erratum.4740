Changed "query" to "response".

<a href="#section-4.3.2">Section 4.3.2</a> describes the algorithm used by nameservers to answer
queries. I.e., a nameserver receives a query from a client, and then it
performs this algorithm in order to construct a response to send to the
client.
<p/>
Steps 1, 3, and 5 of this algorithm talk about setting fields or bits in
the response, or about adding resource records to the answer section of
the response, but then step 6 says to add resource records to the
additional section of the *query*. This doesn't make any sense, because
the server is constructing a response to a query that it's already
received. "Response" must have been intended instead.
