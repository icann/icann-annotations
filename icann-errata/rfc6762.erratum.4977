<div class="original"><pre>
The 'Next Domain Name' field contains the record's own name. When
used with name compression, this means that the 'Next Domain Name'
field always takes exactly two bytes in the message.

<div class="note">
Section 4.1.1 of RFC 4034 states:
<br/><br/>
"A sender MUST NOT use DNS name compression on the Next Domain Name
field when transmitting an NSEC RR."
<br/><br/>
In order to comply with the existing RFC, name compression should not
be suggested.
