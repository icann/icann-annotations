<div class="original"><pre>
  Note that the KeyDigest element is optional; if it
  is not given, the trust anchor can be used until a KeyDigest element
  covering the same DNSKEY record, but having a validUntil attribute,
  is trusted by the relying party.
</pre></div>

<div class="correct">It should say:<pre>
  Note that <ins>the validUntil attribute of </ins>the KeyDigest element is
  optional<del>; if it
  is not given, the trust anchor can be used until a KeyDigest element
  covering the same DNSKEY record, but having a validUntil attribute,
  is trusted by the relying party.</del><ins>. If the relying party is using a trust anchor that has a
  KeyDigest element that does not have a validUntil attribute, it can
  change to a trust anchor with a KeyDigest element that does have a
  validUntil attribute, as long as that trust anchor's validUntil
  attribute is in the future and the DNSKEY elements of the KeyDigest
  are the same as the previous trust anchor.</ins>
</pre></div>

<div class="note">
It is the validUntil attribute that is optional, not the KeyDigest
element. Also, it was noted that the sentence did not clearly explain
the logic.
