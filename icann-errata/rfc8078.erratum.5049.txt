   The contents of the CDS or CDNSKEY RRset MUST contain one RR and only
   contain the exact fields as shown below.

      CDS 0 0 0 0

      CDNSKEY 0 3 0 0

   The keying material payload is represented by a single 0.  This
   record is signed in the same way as regular CDS/CDNSKEY RRsets are
   signed.

   Strictly speaking, the CDS record could be "CDS X 0 X 0" as only the
   DNSKEY algorithm is what signals the DELETE operation, but for
   clarity, the "0 0 0 0" notation is mandated -- this is not a
   definition of DS digest algorithm 0.  The same argument applies to
   "CDNSKEY 0 3 0 0"; the value 3 in the second field is mandated by
   [RFC4034], Section 2.1.2.

   The keying material payload is represented by a single octet with

<div class="note">
RFC 7344 defines both CDS and CDNSKEY record wire and presentation
format to be identical to DS and DNSKEY wire and presentation format
defined in RFC 4034.
<br/><br/>
In case of CDNSKEY record, RFC 4034 section 2.2 requires that:
<br/>
&gt; The Public Key field MUST be represented as a Base64 encoding of the
Public Key.
<br/><br/>
As Base64 encoding encodes 6 bits into one character, one character
alone can never be a valid Base64 sequence. The proper encoding of one-byte
long sequence with binary value of 00 is AA==.
<br/><br/>
In case of CDS record, RFC 4034 section 5.3 requires that:
&gt; The Digest MUST be represented as a sequence of case-insensitive
hexadecimal digits
<br/><br/>
Although the value of a single 0 fulfils this requirement per se, it's
not properly parsable by many implementations since it is expected to be
even number of hex digits to align with octet boundaries in the wire
format. So proper form of CDS record should contain two zeroes in place
of the digest.
