<div class="original"><pre>
   o  If the member name does not end in "HEX", the value is a domain
      name encoded as DNS labels consisting of UTF-8 codepoints from
      U+0000 to U+007F.  Within a label, codepoints above U+007F and the
      codepoint U+002E (ASCII period) MUST be expressed using JSON's
      escaping rules within this set of codepoints.  Separation between
      labels is indicated with a period (codepoint U+002E).
      Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) labels are always expressed in
      their A-label form, as described in [RFC5890].

<div class="correct">It should say:<pre>
   o  If the member name does not end in "HEX", the value is a domain
      name encoded in common display format as DNS labels separated by
      U+002E "." characters. Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) labels
      are always expressed in their A-label form, as described in
      [RFC5890]. Label characters with code points equal to U+0022
      QUOTATION MARK or U+005C REVERSE SOLIDUS or less than U+0020 SPACE
      MUST be expressed using the JSON escaping rules of [RFC8259].
      U+002E "." and U+005C "\" characters within labels MUST be
      preceded by a backslash escape as specified by [RFC1035] (and that
      backslash must itself be escaped for use in a JSON string,
      resulting in either the three-character sequence "\\." or the
      four-character sequence "\\\\", respectively).

<div class="note">
The Original Text appears to specify inclusion of raw characters less
than U+0020 in JSON strings, which is disallowed by section 7 of RFC
8259.
<br/><br/>
Further, as specifically noted in section 8 of RFC 8259,
"implementations that compare strings with escaped characters
unconverted may incorrectly find that "a\\b" and "a\u005Cb" are not
equal", a fact logically deducible from the preceding "when all the
strings represented in a JSON text are composed entirely of Unicode
characters [UNICODE] (however escaped), then that JSON text is
interoperable in the sense that all software implementations that parse
it will agree on the contents of names and of string values in objects
and arrays" text. Therefore, _correct_ JSON implementations must not
distinguish e.g. "a.b.example." from "a\u002Eb.example.", as seems to be
required by the Original Text.
