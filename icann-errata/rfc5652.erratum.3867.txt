<div class="note">
<p>
The text stated that the message digest algorithm is "used by the
signer". It is unclear for what purpose the message digest algorithm is
used.  This recommendation is editorial and was accepted.
</p>
<p>
Additional text provided was not accepted as there is no requirement
that digest used on the body is the same as the digest used in the
signature operation.
</p>
<p>
The following sentence was suggested (and rejected):
"The message digest algorithm shall be equal to the message
digest algorithm used in the signatureAlgorithm field."
</p>
<p>
With the explanation in the original errata report for this additional
sentence as:
</p>
<p>
There are implementations that use the message digest algorithm
specified in the messageDigest field instead of the message digest
algorithm specified in the signatureAlgorithm.
</p>
<p>
Is the purpose of the messageDigest field to nest the hashing algorithm
used in the signing process? If so, please use the corrected text to
clarify the goal of the field.
