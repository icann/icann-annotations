A * label appearing in a query name has no special effect, but can be
used to test for wildcards in an authoritative zone; such a query is the
only way to get a response containing RRs with an owner name with * in
it.  The result of such a query should not be cached.

<div class="note">
It is perfectly OK for an RR with a wildcard label '*' to be cached as
long as it's not used to synthesize any RRs on a caching resolver. The
DNS implementations BIND and Unbound both cache such RRsets with
wildcard label in the owner name.
