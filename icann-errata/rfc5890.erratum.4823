<div class="correct">It should say:<pre>
expansion of the A-label form to a U-label may produce strings that are
much longer than the normal 63 octet DNS limit (potentially up to <del>252
characters</del><ins>59 Unicode code points or 236 octets</ins>)

<div class="note">
The contents of U-labels are encoded in the up to 59 ASCII characters
(see 2.3.2.1 itself)
output by the Punycode algorithm in their corresponding A-labels.  The
Punycode
decoder (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492#section-6.2>) consumes at
least one
of those ASCII characters for each code point inserted into the U-label.
An U-label,
thus, can contain at the most 59 Unicode code points.
<br/>
Since U-labels are defined (in 2.3.2.1) to be expressed in a standard
Unicode Encoding
Form, and UTF-32, UTF-16 and UTF-8 (as revised by RFC3629) all can
encode a code
point in at most 4 octets, 236 octets is an upper bound for an U-label's
length.
<br/>
I think it should be possible to derive a tighter bound, but its
rationale would likely be
less straighforward.
<br/>
I imagine the number 252 was originally derived by multiplying 63, the
maximum
length of an A-label (including the "xn--" prefix), by 4, the maximum
number of
octets needed to represent a code point.
