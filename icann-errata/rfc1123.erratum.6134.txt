5.2.2  Canonicalization: RFC-821 Section 3.1

         The domain names that a Sender-SMTP sends in MAIL and RCPT
         commands MUST have been  "canonicalized," i.e., they must be
         fully-qualified principal names or domain literals, not
         nicknames or domain abbreviations.  A canonicalized name either
         identifies a host directly or is an MX name; it cannot be a
         CNAME.

<div class="correct">It should say:<pre>
RFC5321 Section 2.3.5.  Domain Names

Only resolvable, fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs) are permitted
   when domain names are used in SMTP.  In other words, names that can
   be resolved to MX RRs or address (i.e., A or AAAA) RRs (as discussed
   in Section 5) are permitted, as are CNAME RRs whose targets can be
   resolved, in turn, to MX or address RRs.

<div class="note"><pre>
Section 2.3.5 from RFC 5321 seems to contradict the section 5.2.2 from
1123.

In RFC5321 it is implied that you can have a domain CNAME pointing to
another that has an MX record that is not a CNAME and it should work.
However 1123 states that it's not possible.
--VERIFIER NOTES--
Errata reports are for mistakes in the published document -- errata at
the time of publication.  Anything that might have changed since then is
appropriate for a new document, but isn't errata in the old one.
