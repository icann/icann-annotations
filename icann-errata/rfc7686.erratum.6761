   5.  Authoritative DNS Servers: Authoritative servers MUST respond to
       queries for .onion with NXDOMAIN.

   6.  DNS Server Operators: Operators MUST NOT configure an
       authoritative DNS server to answer queries for .onion.  If they
       do so, client software is likely to ignore any results (see
       above).

<div class="note">
The original text for 5 and 6 is conflicting. A name server cannot
respond with NXDOMAIN (which is an authoritative answer) without having
a zone configured to serve that NXDOMAIN from. Clearly the intent of the
text is that clients will not find authoritative answers to .onion
queries anywhere in the DNS.
