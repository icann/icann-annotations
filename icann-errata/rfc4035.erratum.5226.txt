<div class="original"><pre>
   The need for special processing by a security-aware name server only
   arises when all the following conditions are met:

   o  The name server has received a query for the DS RRset at a zone
      cut.

   o  The name server is authoritative for the child zone.

   o  The name server is not authoritative for the parent zone.

   o  The name server does not offer recursion.

<div class="correct">It should say:<pre>

   o  The name server has received a query for the DS RRset at a zone

<div class="note">
The original text is ambiguous in the face of an authoritative server
having zones C.B.A. and A. but not B.A., and could cause DS queries for
C to return a NODATA at C's apex, instead of the desired referral to B.
which would allow resolution to continue correctly.
