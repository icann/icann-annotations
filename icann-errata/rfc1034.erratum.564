   The usual mail address <&shy;local-part>@<&shy;mail-domain> is mapped into a
   domain name by converting <&shy;local-part> into a single label
   (regardles of dots it contains), converting <&shy;mail-domain> into a
   domain name using the usual text format for domain names (dots
   denote label breaks), and concatenating the two to form a single
   domain name.
