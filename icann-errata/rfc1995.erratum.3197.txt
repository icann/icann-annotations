   RRs in the incremental transfer messages may be partial.  That is, if
   a single RR of multiple RRs of the same RR type changes, only the
   changed RR is transferred.

Rationale:
<br/>
DNS resource records (RRs) are always transferred as integral
entities in the DNS protocol, and IXFR is no exception for this
rule.  So there never are partial RRs in any IXFR response packets.
However, as indicated more precisely in the adjusted text above,
it is intended that partial _RRsets_ are carried in IXFR responses;
unchanged RRs are not sent inside incremental response messages.
<br/>
Historical Note:
<br/>The above issue has been identified by the submitter in 2008,
but no Errata have been filed so far.  However, it already had
been observed in 1999 by Andreas Gustafsson, who, in the context of
the work on RFC 1995bis, recently has provided the DNSEXT WG access
to a privately archived DNSIND mailing list thread on RFC 1995,
in which such issues have been discussed in November 1999.
For the record, the technical issues in RFC 1995 that can be
addressed by Errata Notes are now being submitted this way.
