<hr/>
<div class="note">
"length in the message" is ambiguous for compressed names... taking for
example a compressed domain name that represents "a.b.example.com." as
0x0161 0x0162 0xC00C (i.e., label "a", then label "b", then a pointer to
"example.com." at offset 12), it could mean 1) the count of octets
constituting the absolute name, including both compression pointers and
labels referenced by them (6+13=19), or 2) the count of octets of the
compression pointer plus immediately preceding labels (6), or 3) the
count of octets of labels _preceding_ the compression pointer (4), or
even 4) the offset in the compression pointer (12).
<br/><br/>
The above Corrected Text specifies option 3, because that interpretation
allows for the most uniform treatment of compressed vs. uncompressed
names.
