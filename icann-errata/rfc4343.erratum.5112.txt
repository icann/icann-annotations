--- Original report ---
<br/>
Some authoritative DNS servers and/or mitigation devices/software
silently drop queries that have uppercase letters in them.  Furthermore,
the clarification of the case insensitive comparison in the following
two sentences after that particular sentence use the term MUST.  I
suspect some readers of the RFC are reading the word "should" and aren't
reading the rest of the paragraph.

<br/>
---- WK Update ----
<br/>
The full quote is: "According to the original DNS design decision,
comparisons on name
lookup for DNS queries should be case insensitive [STD13]. ", and the
title of this (RFC4343) is "Domain Name System (DNS) Case Insensitivity
Clarification" -- seeing as the whole point of this document is to
clarify the original spec, I think that readers will read the RFC2119
bits.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I do agree that this could be better worded, and future updates
of this document should probably reword this to make it clearer.
