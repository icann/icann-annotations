<div class="note">
RFC 4648 Section 7 says: 'This encoding may be referred to as
"base32hex".  This encoding should not be regarded as the same as the
"base32" encoding and should not be referred to as only "base32".'
<br/><br/>
There are many spots in RFC 5155 that use the term base32 where
base32hex is the appropriate term. Section 3.3 above is the most
important, but Section 1.1 uses the term as well Section 3 paragraph 4
and Section 3.2 paragraph 8.
