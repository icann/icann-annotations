<div class="original"><pre>
The recommended policy for dealing with MD RRs found in
a master file is to reject them, or to convert them to MX RRs with a
preference of 10.

<div class="correct">It should say:<pre>
The recommended policy for dealing with <del>MD</del><ins>MF</ins> RRs found in
a master file is to reject them, or to convert them to MX RRs with a
preference of 10.

<div class="note">
3.3.5 about MF says "dealing with MD". It should probably say "dealing
with MF". I assume this is a copy and paste error from earlier section
about MD.
