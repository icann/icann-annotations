When a response is so long that truncation is required, the truncation
should start at the end of the response and work forward in the
datagram.  Thus if there is any data for the authority section, the
answer section is guaranteed to be unique.

<div class="note">
It's not clear what it might mean for an answer section to be unique.
However, by following the algorithm described of removing RRs from the
back to the front, if any RRs remain in the authority (or additional)
section, the answer section is guaranteed to be complete.
