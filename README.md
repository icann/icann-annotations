# RFC Annotations from ICANN

This repository is a partner to the [RFC Annotations tool](https://github.com/icann/rfc-annotations).

__IMPORTANT NOTE__: This project is pre-release. We are encouraging new issues and
pull requests, and will incorporate changes as appropriate until approximately October 2022.
At that point, the project will have its first official release.
For now, consider this an alpha release where significant features and interfaces
may change before the final release.

There are two directories here:

* **icann-updates** contains annotations listing what part of an RFC was updated by another RFC.
Although the generated RFC says which RFCs update it, it doesn't say how.
The annotations here are an attempt to say where an RFC is updated, and how it is updated.

* **icann-errata** contains the errata of an RFC, placed inline with where the errata should appear.
There may also be informal notes about the errata.
