@@RFC2308@@ is a major restatement and update to how negative caching should
be implemented. Its abstract begins:
<br>
<pre>
[RFC1034] provided a description of how to cache negative responses.
It however had a fundamental flaw in that it did not allow a name
server to hand out those cached responses to other resolvers, thereby
greatly reducing the effect of the caching.  This document addresses
issues raise in the light of experience and replaces [RFC1034 Section
4.3.4].
