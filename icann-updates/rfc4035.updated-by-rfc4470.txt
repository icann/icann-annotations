#C RFC 4470 redefines minimally covering NSEC records
#S 2.3
<p>
Section 3 of @@RFC4470@@ says:
<br>
<pre>
The generated NSEC record's type bitmap MUST have the RRSIG and NSEC
bits set and SHOULD NOT have any other bits set.  This relaxes the
requirement in Section 2.3 of RFC4035 that NSEC RRs not appear at
names that did not exist before the zone was signed.
</pre>
