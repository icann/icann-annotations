#C RFC 4035 changes what else can exist with a zone cut, namely NSEC and DS RRs
#L 1087

Section 2.6 of @@RFC4035@@ says:
<br>
<pre>
DNSSEC introduced two new RR types that are unusual in that they can
appear at the parental side of a zone cut.  At the parental side of a
zone cut (that is, at a delegation point), NSEC RRs are REQUIRED at
the owner name.  A DS RR could also be present if the zone being
delegated is signed and seeks to have a chain of authentication to
the parent zone.  This is an exception to the original DNS
specification ([RFC1034]), which states that only NS RRsets could
appear at the parental side of a zone cut.

This specification updates the original DNS specification to allow
NSEC and DS RR types at the parent side of a zone cut.  These RRsets
are authoritative for the parent when they appear at the parent side
of a zone cut.
