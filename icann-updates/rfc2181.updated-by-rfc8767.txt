#C RFC 8767 updates many aspects of TTL calculations	
#S 8
<p>All of @@RFC8767@@ touches on aspects of how TTLs are calculated
and used by resolvers. In particular, RFC 8767 says that it
"updates RFC 2181 by interpreting values with the high-order bit set as being
positive, rather than 0, and suggests a cap of 7 days".
