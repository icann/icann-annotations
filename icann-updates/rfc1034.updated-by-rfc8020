#C RFC 8020 clarifies empty non-terminals and zone cuts
#L 349
<p>
@@RFC8020@@ extensively describes how zone cuts are determined,
particularly in the presence of empty non-terminals.
It says "This document states clearly that when a DNS resolver receives a
response with a response code of NXDOMAIN, it means that the domain
name which is thus denied AND ALL THE NAMES UNDER IT do not exist."

Section 3.1 of RFC 8020 says:
<br>
<pre>
This document clarifies possible ambiguities in [RFC1034] that did
not clearly distinguish Empty Non-Terminal (ENT) names ([RFC7719])
from nonexistent names, and it refers to subsequent documents that
do.  ENTs are nodes in the DNS that do not have resource record sets
associated with them but have descendant nodes that do.  The correct
response to ENTs is NODATA (i.e., a response code of NOERROR and an
empty answer section).  Additional clarifying language on these
points is provided in Section 7.16 of [RFC2136] and in Sections 2.2.2
and 2.2.3 of [RFC4592].
