@@RFC5891@@ says that it updates RFC 3492, but it doesn't really do so.
Instead, Section 4.4 says:
<br/>
<pre>
This document does not update or alter the
Punycode algorithm specified in RFC 3492 in any way.  RFC 3492 does
make a non-normative reference to the information about the value and
construction of the ACE prefix that appears in RFC 3490 or Nameprep
[RFC3491].  For consistency and reader convenience, IDNA2008
effectively updates that reference to point to this document.  That
change does not alter the prefix itself.  The prefix, "xn--", is the
same in both sets of documents.
</pre>
</p>
