#C Changes to the TTL values from RFC 9077
#L 372
<p>@@RFC9077@@ changes "The NSEC3 RR SHOULD have the same TTL value as the SOA minimum TTL
field.  This is in the spirit of negative caching [RFC2308]." to:
<br/>
<pre>
The TTL of the NSEC3 RR that is returned MUST be the lesser of the
MINIMUM field of the SOA record and the TTL of the SOA itself.
This matches the definition of the TTL for negative responses in
[RFC2308].  Because some signers incrementally update the NSEC3
chain, a transient inconsistency between the observed and expected
TTL MAY exist.

<p>@@RFC9077@@ changes "The TTL value for any NSEC3 RR SHOULD be the same as the
minimum TTL value field in the zone SOA RR." to:

<pre>
*  The TTL value for each NSEC3 RR MUST be the lesser of the
   MINIMUM field of the zone SOA RR and the TTL of the zone SOA RR
   itself.  Because some signers incrementally update the NSEC3
