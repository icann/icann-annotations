#C RFC 8767 allows caching of records past their TTL
#L 649
<p>
The abstract of @@RFC8767@@ says:
"This document defines a method (serve-stale) for recursive resolvers
to use stale DNS data to avoid outages when authoritative nameservers
cannot be reached to refresh expired data."
The reason this updates RFC 1034 is that the definition of TTL in
RFC 1034 says "The TTL describes how
long a RR can be cached before it should be discarded."
RFC 8767 softens that "should" and describes various scenarios when
it is acceptable to serve stale data.
