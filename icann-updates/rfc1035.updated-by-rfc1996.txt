@@RFC1996@@, which defines the DNS NOTIFY mechanism,
extensively uses the SOA fields for determining when a
zone is updated. It says:
<br>
<pre>
1.3. This document intentionally gives more definition to the roles
of "Master," "Slave" and "Stealth" servers, their enumeration in NS
RRs, and the SOA MNAME field.  In that sense, this document can be
considered an addendum to [RFC1035].
