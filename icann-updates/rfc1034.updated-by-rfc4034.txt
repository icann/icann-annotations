#A ICANN
#C RFC 4034 changes what else can exist with a CNAME, namely RRSIG RRs
#L 780
<p>
Section 3 of @@RFC4034@@ says:
<br>
<pre>
Because every authoritative RRset in a zone must be protected by a
digital signature, RRSIG RRs must be present for names containing a
CNAME RR.  This is a change to the traditional DNS specification
[RFC1034], which stated that if a CNAME is present for a name, it is
the only type allowed at that name.  A RRSIG and NSEC (see Section 4)
MUST exist for the same name as a CNAME resource record in a signed
zone.

Similar wording is found in Section 2.5 of @@RFC4035@@.
