#C RFC 9077 updates TTLs and aggressive use
#L 302
<p>
@@RFC9077@@ updates many RFCs to clarify how TTLs are calculated
when using DNSSEC. For RFC 4035, it replaces:
<br>
<pre>
The TTL value for any NSEC RR SHOULD be the same as the minimum
TTL value field in the zone SOA RR.
</pre>
<p>
with:
<p>
<pre>
The TTL of the NSEC RR that is returned MUST be the lesser of the
MINIMUM field of the SOA record and the TTL of the SOA itself.
This matches the definition of the TTL for negative responses in
[RFC2308].  Because some signers incrementally update the NSEC
chain, a transient inconsistency between the observed and expected
TTL MAY exist.
