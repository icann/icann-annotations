<pre>
Section 2.1 of [RFC2308] implies that the RCODE should
be set based on the last query cycle in the case of an xNAME chain,
but Section 2.2.1 of [RFC2308] says that some servers don't do that!

When there is an xNAME chain, the RCODE field is set as follows:

   When an xNAME chain is followed, all but the last query cycle
   necessarily had no error.  The RCODE in the ultimate DNS response
   MUST BE set based on the final query cycle leading to that
   response.  If the xNAME chain was terminated by an error, it will
   be that error code.  If the xNAME chain terminated without error,
   it will be zero.
