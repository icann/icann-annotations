#C RFC 2181 and the TTLs on SOA records
#L 588
<p>
Section 7.2 of @@RFC2181@@ says:
<br>
<pre>
It may be observed that in section 3.2.1 of RFC1035, which defines
the format of a Resource Record, that the definition of the TTL field
contains a throw away line which states that the TTL of an SOA record
should always be sent as zero to prevent caching.  This is mentioned
nowhere else, and has not generally been implemented.
Implementations should not assume that SOA records will have a TTL of
zero, nor are they required to send SOA records with a TTL of zero.
