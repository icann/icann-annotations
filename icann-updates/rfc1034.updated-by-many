<p>
Many of the RFCs that are listed as updating RFC 1034 actually just
mention it, but don't actually update anything here.
For example, many of them simply define new RRtypes, which is not really an update
to RFC 1034, just to the IANA registry it created.
The RFCs that do update RFC 1034 are listed throughout this document.
